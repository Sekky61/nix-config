# VSCode settings

My personal settings, keybindings and extensions for VSCode.
Used by [my dotfiles](https://github.com/Sekky61/dotfiles) to automatically setup VSCode.
`copy_settings.sh` extracts the settings files (works on Ubuntu).

## Location of VS Code settings

```
Windows `%APPDATA%\Code\User\settings.json`
Linux `$HOME/.config/Code/User/settings.json`
```
